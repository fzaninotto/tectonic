    <h2>What is Tectonic?</h2>

<p>Tectonic is a small library that makes loading REST API data a one-liner within your redux apps.</p>

<h2>Why should I use it?</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll write 80% less data loading code: no more action, reducer, normalizr, reselect boilerplate.</p>

<p>Tectonic handles all actions, reducer data management, and prop injection for you &emdash; with one line.  Plus you can swap out real data for fake data using a mock driver with one line.</p>

<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s fast to write and maintain, plus it&rsquo;ll save your sanity.</p>

<h2>But I love writing actions, normalizers, reducers, and reselect queries!</h2>

<p>Homie, you loco!.  We won&rsquo;t reach out from your monitor and slap you, but if you don&rsquo;t get your data shape right you&rsquo;ll spend a ton of time reworking each reselect query and reducer.  Plus, this takes a <em>lot of time</em>.  Don&rsquo;t you get bored?</p>

<h2>What about GraphQL?  I wanna use that.</h2>

<p>Love it!  Unfortunately you need a GraphQL endpoint to hit, though, and sometimes that&rsquo;s <em>just not available</em>.  In this case Tectonic provides an adapter for you to have declerative data loading over a REST API which will tide you over.</p>

<p>If you can use it you should&hellip; relay 2 is looking excellent and Apollo is also very great work.</p>

<h2>How do I get started?</h2>

<p>Head over to the SETUP GUIDE to learn how to use it.</p>

<h2>You got one of those example projects?</h2>

<p>Knock yourself out!</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Each time you ask for data to be loaded via THE <code>@load</code> DECORATOR you create a QUERY.  This query specifies things like whether you&rsquo;re asking for a single item or a list of items, the MODEL that you need loaded, and the parameters you&rsquo;re passing in to load data.</p>

<p>Tectonic then takes each query and passes it to a RESOLVER.   It&rsquo;s the RESOLVER&rsquo;S job to inspect each query and match it against every SOURCE DEFINITION that you specified, figuring out which API endpoint to hit.  Once the RESOLVER has a valid SOURCE DEFINITION for a QUERY, tectonic invokes the SOURCE DEFINITION to load your data.  The data is then normalized and stored with cache information from the server&rsquo;s response inside tectonic&rsquo;s REDUCER.</p>

<p>Finally, THE <code>@load</code> DECORATOR is given the data for each query and passes it down to your component.</p>

<p>This is a pretty basic overview that hides the complexity of the resolver and decorator.  Things like dependent data loading (eg. load user A then once user A&rsquo;s data is loaded use those props to load their list of posts, or N+1 problems) make this more complex.  For more information on how Tectonic works check out the INTERNALS documentation.</p>

<h2>What are these decorator, models, and sources you mention?</h2>

<p>Ah.  Great question.  Kind of key to the whole thing, really.</p>

<p>Head to the getting started guide for an overview, or the INTERNALS guide to read more on each part.</p>

<h2>Why are they called source definitions and not API endpoints?</h2>

<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be an API endpoint.  What if you&rsquo;re using a mock driver, or a localstorage driver?  ðŸ˜‡</p>

<h2>Is it ready to use?</h2>

<p>A few places are using it in production, working out the kinks and improving the API as we go.  The API <em>will probably</em> change as we progress to version 2.0 and there may be bugs.  That said, give it a go and file an issue if you run into anything.</p>

<h2>How does it make AJAX requests?</h2>

<p>Requests are invoked via DRIVERS, so it&rsquo;s interchangeable.  Tectonic ships with a SUPERAGENT driver which (as you might expect) uses the awesome SUPERAGENT library to make requests.</p>

<h2>Wait. Tell me more about these drivers!</h2>

<p>DRIVERS power the logic behind making each API request.  That means you can do some wonderful things with it, such as wrap a driver with a <code>LocalStorage</code> adapter that caches API requests for use offline and provides API responses even if the data connection goes down.</p>

<h2>Can we use websockets?</h2>

<p>If you help WRITE A DRIVER for it then yup, sure!</p>

<h2>How do I file an issue?</h2>

<p>Head over to GitHub, my friend.  I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you, in a totally non creepy way.</p>
